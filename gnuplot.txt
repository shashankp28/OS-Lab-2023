To plot a graph for the number of page faults against the total number of frames using gnuplot, you can follow the below steps:

Save the number of page faults for each configuration in a data file. The data file should have two columns, the first column representing the total number of frames and the second column representing the number of page faults for that configuration.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the data file is saved.

Launch gnuplot by typing "gnuplot" in the terminal.

In the gnuplot prompt, type the following commands:

python
Copy code
set xlabel "Total Number of Frames"
set ylabel "Number of Page Faults"
set title "Page Faults vs Total Number of Frames"
plot "datafile.dat" with lines
Replace "datafile.dat" with the name of your data file.

Press enter to execute the plot command. Gnuplot will display the graph on the screen.

You can save the graph in a file by typing the following command in the gnuplot prompt:

python
Copy code
set term png
set output "graph.png"
replot
This will save the graph in a file named "graph.png" in the current directory. You can replace "graph.png" with any other filename of your choice.

To exit gnuplot, type "quit" in the gnuplot prompt.

Note: Make sure you have gnuplot installed on your system before following the above steps.
